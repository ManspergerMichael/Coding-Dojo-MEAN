Trivia game uses the Open Triva Database API to get 10 random trivia questions. 
I have the framework for the game set up and can inform the user if they got the answer right or wrong.
To do for later: Impove game logic, harder questions get more points
                Randomize placement of correct answer, currently top selection is alwase right answer
